## Course Description

This course offers an introductory overview of Cognitive Linguistics, a discipline that examines language as a cognitive function and the mind through language. 
Key topics include categorisation, metaphor, image schemas, mental spaces, the mental lexicon, conceptualisation in grammar, the representation of language in the mind, and embodied language processing.

Drawing on insights from text analysis, language acquisition, psycholinguistic experimentation and neurolinguistic evidence, the course provides students with an understanding of the relationship between linguistic structure, thought, and embodied human experience, as well as its implications for education and language teaching.
