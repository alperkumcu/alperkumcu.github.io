## Description

This course offers an introductory overview of Cognitive Linguistics, a discipline that examines language as a cognitive function and the mind through language. It explores fundamental concepts such as categorisation, prototypes, image schemas, conceptual metaphor, mental spaces, the mental lexicon, conceptualisation in grammar, discourse, and embodied language processing.

Drawing on evidence from text analysis, language acquisition, psycholinguistic experimentation, neurolinguistic research, and brain imaging, the course provides students with an understanding of how language is structured in the mind and brain, how it reflects thought, and how it relates to embodied human experience.

##  Objectives & Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Explain the core principles of Cognitive Linguistics, including usage-based and meaning-as-conceptualization perspectives.
- Analyze how language is represented and processed in the mind and brain, drawing on psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic evidence.
- Apply cognitive models of embodiment, image schemas, and conceptual metaphor to understand meaning construction and their potential role in teaching abstract concepts.
- Evaluate key conceptual structures such as categorisation, polysemy, mental spaces, conceptual blending, and cognitive grammar, and reflect on their implications for language learning.
- Interpret discourse and figurative language from a cognitive perspective, and connect Cognitive Linguistics to broader applications in research, communication, and language education through independent projects.

## Content

- Foundations of Cognitive Linguistics: Core principles, usage-based perspectives, and categorisation.
- Mind, Brain, and Embodiment: Neurolinguistic evidence, image schemas, and conceptual metaphor theory.
- Language Processing and Meaning: Embodied semantics, polysemy, and the mental lexicon.
- Conceptual Structures in Language: Mental spaces, conceptual blending, and cognitive grammar.
- Discourse and Applications: Figurative language, pragmatics, and student-led projects.
