## Course Description
This course provides a comprehensive and interdisciplinary overview of Interpreting Studies, exploring its theoretical foundations, methodological approaches, and connections with related disciplines such as cognitive science, linguistics, sociology, and communication studies. Students will examine the historical development of interpreting research and gain insight into key theoretical frameworks, including cognitive, linguistic, sociological, communicative, and pedagogical perspectives. Through readings, discussions, and student-led presentations, the course emphasizes the dynamic and evolving nature of interpreting as both an academic discipline and a professional practice. In addition to engaging with seminal and contemporary scholarship, students will develop essential academic skills such as critical reading, scholarly writing, and systematic analysis.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Recognize the historical development and interdisciplinary relations of interpreting research.  
- Explain current trends and future projections in the field.  
- Use conceptual, methodological, and terminological knowledge in interpreting studies.  
- Evaluate, interpret, and critique research in the field.  
- Write a response/reaction paper and a review/meta-analysis article.

## Evaluation System
Students enrolled on the course are expected to moderate at least one session during the semester, based on that week's reading list. In addition to the existing reading list, the student moderator will add a book chapter and/or research article of their choice to the session. All students, including the moderator, must prepare at least one discussion question based on the week's reading list and share it with the class in advance. The discussion will be based on these questions. During weeks when a research article is read, all students must complete and hand in an 'Article Evaluation Form' for marking. Article Evaluation Forms are due the day before class.

Students are expected to write a critique (response paper) of at least 3,000 words, which will replace the mid-term exam. Students will choose their own interpreting studies article to evaluate. At the end of the semester, they will be expected to prepare and submit a review article, which will replace the final exam. Papers submitted after the deadline will be penalised by 10 points for each day late.

Midterm Response Paper Submission due date and time: November 11, 2026, Tuesday 23:59
Final Exam Review Paper due date and time: January 6, 2026, Tuesday 23:59


- **Presentations:** 25% 
- **Mid-term reponse paper:** 25%
