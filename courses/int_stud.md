- Explain current trends and future projections in the field.  
- Use conceptual, methodological, and terminological knowledge in interpreting studies.  
- Evaluate, interpret, and critique research in the field.  
- Write a review/meta-analysis article or a response/reaction paper.

## Evaluation System
Students enrolled on the course are expected to moderate at least one session during the semester, based on that week's reading list. In addition to the existing reading list, the student moderator will add a book chapter and/or research article of their choice to the session. All students, including the moderator, must prepare at least one discussion question based on the week's reading list and share it with the class in advance. The discussion will be based on these questions. During weeks when a research article is read, all students must complete and hand in an 'Article Evaluation Form' for marking. Article Evaluation Forms are due the day before class.

Students are expected to write a critique (response paper) of at least 3,000 words, which will replace the mid-term exam. Students will choose their own interpreting studies article to evaluate. At the end of the semester, they will be expected to prepare and submit a review article, which will replace the final exam. Papers submitted after the deadline will be penalised by 10 points for each day late.
