## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course offers an introductory overview of Cognitive Linguistics, a
discipline that examines language as a cognitive function and the mind
through language. Key topics include categorisation, metaphor, image
schemas, mental spaces, the mental lexicon, conceptualisation in
grammar, the representation of language in the mind, and embodied
language processing. Drawing on insights from text analysis, language
acquisition, psycholinguistic experimentation and neurolinguistic
evidence, the course provides students with an understanding of the
relationship between linguistic structure, thought, and embodied human
experience, as well as its implications for education and language
teaching.
