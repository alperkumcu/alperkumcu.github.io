I'm transferring my PhD thesis (written in .docx) into a R Markdown document using ```markdown``` and ```bookdown``` packages in R. The output will be presented on this page as an interactive .html file.  

This is a [work](https://alperkumcu.github.io/thesis/index.html) in progress. Please refer to the [repository](https://etheses.bham.ac.uk/id/eprint/8842/) of University of Birmingham for the time being.
